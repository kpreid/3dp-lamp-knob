This is a knob intended to fit onto the knurled shafts of lamps' rotary switches, allowing them to be turned easily without a precise and firm grip. Good for reaching past obstacles, wet hands, disabilities, and just getting it done easier.

* The sleeve part is slightly elliptical so that it grips the shaft as it is pushed on. It must be fairly closely sized to fit the shaft. In the lamps I have fitted this onto, sizes that have worked are 5.6 mm and 6.1 mm; these were both torchiere-style lamps with long switch shafts rather than the short black plastic kind common on desk lamps.
* It is not intended as a replacement to fit on shafts that originally had screw-on knobs â€” it might work but I don't have any of those to try. In that case the elliptical shape should be removed.

The decorative pattern was inspired by antique keys/knobs but is original. I designed it with multi-material printing in mind but have not yet attempted to print it that way.

## Printing

Print with a brim, so that the narrow base is well attached to the print bed.

Caveat: The design has a bit of excessive overhang and prints with some ugliness where the diagonal supports meet the bottom of the circles.
